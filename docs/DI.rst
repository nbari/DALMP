Dependency injection
====================

**DALMP** offers a set of classes that allows you to work with MySQL, Cache
backends and sessions, but when trying to use all this together, some
perfomance issues may be raised, so to deal with this, a DI
(`dependecy injector <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection>`_) is high recomendable.
